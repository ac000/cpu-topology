Overview
========

cpu-topology.py is a simple python script that displays cpu topology 
information gathered from /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology.


Examples
========

Single CPU
----------

System appears to be uni-processor


Single hyperthreaded cpu
------------------------

CPU Topology (Hyperthreaded)

CPU 0
    Threads: 2

Number of CPUs    =  1
Number of threads =  2


SMP
---

CPU Topology (SMP)

CPU 0
CPU 1

Number of CPUs    =  2


Multicore
---------

CPU Topology (Multicore)

CPU 0
    Cores: 4

Number of CPUs    =  1
Number of cores   =  4


SMP + Multicore
---------------

CPU Topology (SMP / Multicore)

CPU 0
    Cores: 2
CPU 1
    Cores: 2

Number of CPUs    =  2
Number of cores   =  4
